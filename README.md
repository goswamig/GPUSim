We are trying to emulate the GPU performance without running the training on GPU.
We are considering following aspects
1. Kernel time 
2. Memory overhead
3. Network bandwidth
4. Degree of parallelism

Profiling 
Single-node 
Multi-node with specific network setup 

GPU architecture: The simulation will have to have support for GPU architecure type.
